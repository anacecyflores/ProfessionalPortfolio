                            the user based on location and career
                            option. Once the user takes our carefully designed personality/aptitude test the user will

                            option that will fit their personality.

                            A key feature of our project is the login portion for the user to keep their progress,
                            information and job interests
                            saved for their next visit which is stored into our very own user information database.

                            The job search api, Google Map, individualized quiz, calendar for reminders and dashboard
                            facilitate the job seeking
                            experience for the user to stay in our site alone instead of navigating through various job
